# Deep Learning framework for Line-level Handwritten Text Recognition

This github provides a framework to train and test CRNN networks on handwritten line-level datasets.

1. Intro \
    1.a The HTR line-level task \
    1.b The CRNN structure 
    
2. Installation \
    2.a : Install conda environment \
    2.b Download databases
    - IAM dataset
    - ICFHR 2014 dataset


3. How to use
    - Make predictions using our best networks
    - train and test a network on a dataset
    

## 2. Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Anaconda installed (version >= to 4.7.10, you may not be able to install correct dependencies if older). 
If not, follow the installation instructions provided at 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.

Also pull the git. 


### 2.a Download  and activate conda environment
Once in the git folder on your machine, run the command lines :
``` 
conda env create -f HTR_environment.yml
conda activate HTR 
```   

### 2.b Download databases
You will only need to download these databases if you want to train your own network from scratch. The framework is built to train a network on one of these 2 datasets : 
[IAM](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database) and [ICFHR2014 HTR competition](http://www.transcriptorium.eu/~htrcontest/contestICFHR2014/public_html/). 

Make sure to download the two databases in the same folder. Structure must be 
```
Your data folder / 
    IAM/
        lines.txt
        lines/
        split/
            trainset.txt
            testset.txt
            validationset1.txt
            validationset2.txt
            
    ICFHR2014/
        BenthamDatasetR0-GT/ 
```


## 3. How to use

### 3.a Make predictions on your own dataset
Coming soon...

### 3.b Train a network from scratch

``` 
python train.py --dataset dataset  -- data_dir data_dir --logdir logdir
``` 
Before running the code, make sure that you change `ROOT_PATH` variable at the beginning of `params.py` to the path of the folder you want to save your models in. 
Main arguments : 
- `--dataset`: name of the dataset to train and test on. 
Supported values are `ICFHR2014` and `IAM`.
- `--data_path`: location of the train dataset folder on local machine. See section [??] for downloading datasets.


Main learning arguments : 
- `data_aug`: If set to `True`, will apply random affine data transformation to the training images.
- `--optimizer`: Which optimizer to use. 
Supported values are `rmsprop`, `adam`, `adadelta`, and `sgd`. 
We recommend using RMSprop, which got best results in our experiments. See `params.py` for optimizer-specific parameters.

- `--epochs` : Number of training epochs
- `--lr`: Learning rate at the beginning of training.
- `--milestones`: List of the epochs at which the learning rate will be divided by 10.
